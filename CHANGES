v0.1, 2013-07-17 -- First release.

v0.2, 2013-07-18
	* fixed error in __all__ list

v0.3, 2013-07-23
	* bug fix:
		off-by one error caused the queue to not reheapify properly in the special case when an existing item in position 1 had its pkey decreased below that of its parent at position 0 (the root).

v0.4, 2013-12-08
	* Several API changes:
		- renamed peek() to top()
		- semantics of top, pop, vs. topitem, popitem, *item, now hopefully more consistent
		- prioritykeys() and iterprioritykeys() are aliases for values() and itervalues()
	* Added new PQDict methods: 
		- pushpopitem
		- swap_priority
		- replace_key
	* Added new functions:
		- nsmallest, nlargest
		- consume
	* Added Sphinx documentation

v0.5, 2014-02-09
	* API changes:
		- PQDict.pq_type is now a property: 'min', 'max' or 'custom'
		- fromkeys keyword 'sort_by' is replaced with 'rank_by'
	* Bug fixes:
		- turns out PQDict.create and sort_by_value were broken! (oops!)
		- consume: the collector was comparing the wrong pkeys
	* Improved test coverage:
		- all new features have unit tests now
		- using travis-ci

v0.6, 2015-08-31
	* Conceptual changes:
		- Clearer terminology in API and documentation (e.g., value vs. priority key).
		- Functional philosophy: pqdict accepts optional sort key function and precedence function.
	* API changes:
		- ``PQDict`` name is deprecated.
		- Several backwards-incompatible changes to fit the new conceptual model.Heapsort iterators (iterkeys, itervalues, iteritems) were renamed (popkeys, popvalues, popitems). In Python 2, the old names persist as regular iterators.
		- Killed all module functions except for nlargest and nsmallest.
	* Docs:
		- Revised and updated
		- Switch to RTD theme
